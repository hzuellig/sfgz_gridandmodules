            <h3>Lyrics</h3>

            <i>[Flux Pavilion:]</i><br>
            I can't stop-op-op-op<br>
            I can't stop<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]</i><br>
            This is something like the Holocaust<br>
            Millions of our people lost<br>
            Bow our heads and pray to the Lord<br>
            'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball<br>
            Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads<br>
            Whole lotta money in a black bag<br>
            Black strap: you know what that's for<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Jay-Z, Kanye West:]</i><br>
            Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Yeah, who gon' stop me?<br>
            No brakes, I need State Farm<br>
            So many watches, I need eight arms<br>
            One neck but got eight charms<br>
            Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kanye West:]</i><br>
            Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay<br>
            That's Pig Latin, itch-bay; who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel<br>
            Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, "Yes!" Tell Howard Cosell<br>
            You just a commentator if you getting paper<br>
            Everybody I know from the hood got common haters<br>
            In some relations, you just supposed to say none<br>
            Heard she fucked the doorman<br>
            Well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress<br>
            Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis<br>
            I only like green faces<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]</i><br>
            This is something like the Holocaust<br>
            Millions of our people lost<br>
            Bow our heads and pray to the Lord<br>
            'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball<br>
            Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads<br>
            Whole lotta money in a black bag<br>
            Black strap: you know what that's for<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Kanye West and Jay-Z:]</i><br>
            Y'all weed purple, my money purple<br>
            Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah's circle (Yeah, yeah, let's go)<br>
            I wrote the verse that I hope will hurt you<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]</i><br>
            Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Beat the odds, beat the Feds<br>
            It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid<br>
            Start me broke, I bet I get rich<br>
            Night shift: six to six<br>
            Give me one shot, one pot<br>
            I'll show up in all white, wearin' no socks<br>
            No ceiling, new coupe<br>
            They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof<br>
            I'm three steps removed, I know how to move<br>
            It's looking like I don't know how to lose<br>
            I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn<br>
            I'm at the table, I'm gamblin'<br>
            Lucky lefty, I expect a seven<br>
            I went through hell, I'm expectin' heaven<br>
            I'm owed, 'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code<br>
            I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere<br>
            OK, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats<br>
            I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope<br>
            Like ha, I ain't no joke<br>
            I can't be stopped, like nope, like nope<br>
            Extend the beat, Noah (...and pray to the Lord), uh<br>
            <br>
            <i>[Jay-Z:]</i><br>
            Two seats in the 911, uh<br>
            No limit on the Black Card, uh<br>
            Told y'all I was gonna go H·A·M, uh<br>
            'Til the ocean was my backyard, uh<br>
            No lies in my verses, hey<br>
            Please pardon all the curses, hey<br>
            Shit gotta come in some way, fuck<br>
            When you're growing up worthless, uh<br>
            Middle finger to my old life, uh<br>
            Special shout-out to my old head, uh<br>
            If it wasn't for your advice, uh<br>
            A nigga would have been so dead, uh<br>
            I'm living life 'til these niggas kill me<br>
            Turn this up if you niggas feel me<br>
            I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy<br>
            Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes<br>
            Graduated to the MoMA<br>
            And I did all of this without a diploma<br>
            Graduated from the corner<br>
            Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna<br>
            Street-smart and I'm book-smart<br>
            Coulda been a chemist 'cause I cook smart<br>
            Only thing that can stop me is me, hey<br>
            And I'ma stop when the hook start, hol' up<br>
            <br>

            This is something like the Holocaust<br>

            Bow our heads and pray to the Lord<br>
            'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball<br>
            Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?<br>
            Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads<br>
            Whole lotta money in a black bag<br>
            Black strap: you know what that's for
