            <p>Remember the night you picked me up? <br>
                We drove till the Sun rose<br>
                I'll never forget how you looked at me<br>
                That was when time froze<br>
                I tried to hide it but I can't deny it<br>
                I think about you more than I like to admit<br>
                I still think of you after all this time<br>
                Do you think of me too? Just give me a sign, boy<br>
                I still think of you even though you're not mine<br>
                I try to play it cool, but I still think of you<br>
                I wanna play under the stars, covered in moonlight<br>
                I wanna stay here in your arms where everything's alright<br>
                When you tell me sweet lies<br>
                I forget to breathe, forget to be your eyes<br>
                I know these games more than I like to admit<br>
                I still think of you after all this time<br>
                Do you think of me too? Just give me a sign, boy<br>
                I still think of you even though you're not mine<br>
                I try to play it cool, but I still think of you<br>
                I still think of you after all this time<br>
                Do you think of me too? Just give me a sign, boy<br>
                I still think of you even though you're not mine<br>
                I try to play it cool, but I still think of you<br>
                I still think of you after all this time<br>
                Do you think of me too? Just give me a sign, boy<br>
